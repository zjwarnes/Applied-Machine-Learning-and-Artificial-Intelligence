- Make sure all import are functioning correctly 
- For Logistic regression, run logisticReg()
- For Linear regression, run linearReg()

-It will permutate through many combinations of lambda,
 and initial values of the weights.
 
 -Not recommended for slower computers
 
 -To increase the speed do the following with lambda and iteration variables
 #TO run faster, switch the comments with the TWO values below
 lbda = [0.1,0.3,1.0,3.0,10]
 num = 5    
 #lbda = 1.0
 #num = 1
 
 
*****Instructions for Naive Bayes *****
 
standard naive bayes, using guassian distribution. takes as input, the .csv, will be submitted as "naive bayes.csv",
outputs a new .csv, output.csv, with the first column the ID of all runners, and the second column a "boolean", that is either
-1 or 1. -1 means will not compete in 2017. 1 means will compete in 2017.

To run it, just have the python script in the same directory as a csv named aaadata.csv, which has the same format as "naive bayes.csv, and build the script"



For simplicity and analysis purpose, we have merged the prediction outputs in single file, named Prediction_file.csv as per 
the requires format as Participant_ID 	Y1_LOGISTIC	Y1_NAIVEBAYES	Y2_REGRESSION
which has the values for Y1 as 0(will not participate)/1 (will participate) and Y2 has predicted finish time.
