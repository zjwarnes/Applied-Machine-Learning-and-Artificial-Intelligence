##Readme for Naive Bayes Implementation and SKLearn Implementations##

The data files should be in the same directory as the code. 

In order to run the NB Implementation, use simply run python NB.py. Make sure lines 432 is uncommented or it will also run the sklearn implementations. This will split the data, create a frequency table, and categorize the validation set.

To run the SKLearn Implementation, also use NB.py but uncomment line 432, which will run the SKLearn method. You may pick which classifier you would like to use by choosing a classifier between lines 384 and 388.
